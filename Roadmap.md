**Operating System and Linux:**

In Operating System Kernel is act like a Heart, It communicate with (CPU, Memory, Disk ) and Biuld the communication between the Software.
Process Management: It give the information between the How process is starting and Running , Stopping details it will give. And How its Distributed the CPU time to scheduler details it will store
 * PID - It is the Uniq number for the process running 
 * Daemon/Service are the continuously running process in background

Memory Management: It give the how the process is Distributed the memory to each and every process
RAM/Swap are the examples

File System management: How the file system store the data and How its process the data is give the complete picture.

***Linux Fundamentals:***

1️⃣ Linux Architecture (Very Important)

Linux consists of four major layers:

✔ 1. Hardware Layer

CPU, Memory, Storage, Network Cards.

✔ 2. Kernel Layer

The core of the OS — responsible for:
Process management, Memory management, Device management, File system management, Networking and I/O scheduling

✔ 3. System Libraries

Examples: glibc, libstdc++
Used by applications to call the kernel via system calls (read, write, fork, exec…)

✔ 4. User Applications

Shell, utilities, user programs.
